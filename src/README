IBEN provides an interactive interface to Jørn Lind-Nielsen's BUDDY
BDD package. IBEN is loosely based on a similar tool in David Long's
BDD package with minor modifications to accommodate differences
between the packages.

The program reads commands from standard input using the readline
library (which provides editing and command history facilities) and
writes to standard output.
